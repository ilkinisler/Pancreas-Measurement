# Pancreas-Measurement

The notebook is self-explanatory. At the time I was working on this, the input files were not very organized so I had to use bunch of different ones. I put them all in a zip file.

inputs:
inside allcsvfilesused.zip

outputs:
printed dataframes visible in the notebook and all saved dataframes.
